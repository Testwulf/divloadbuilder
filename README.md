# The Division Loadout Builder

I have way too much gear that I keep on hand to optimize my loadout by hand. It has come to a point where I can no longer mentally manage the effort, so this program will hopefully help in that regard.

# Initial Target Feature Set

* Enable entering gear into the program including attributes such as
 * Name
 * Armor
 * Firearms, Stamina, and Electronics
* Enable definition of weights to define loadout target attribute layout
* Perform optimization to determine best guess as to loadout gear assignment
 * Investigate Simulated Annealing for initial guess
 * Integrate background analysis and notification for further refinement

# Future Roadmap

* Iteratively expand attribute catalog to include
  * Damage to NPC Armor
  * Bonus XP on Kill
  * Etc.
